        Hi, I'm Bob Chin, a programmer from China, the author of SQL Sharper, and also the founder of cnsharp.com.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have been working with .NET and SQL Server since 2004, accumulating 20+ years of hands-on experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2009, I began developing SQL Sharper (originally named SQL#), designed for SSMS 2005/2008/2008R2. 
        Initially, it was an internal tool used within the company I worked for at the time.
    </p>    
        By 2012, I renamed it to SQL Sharper (after discovering sqlsharp.com was already taken) and released it publicly.
    <p>  
        Unfortunately, development was discontinued in 2016 after the company was acquired by a 'Large Company' that shifted its tech stack to Java, 
        and even executed a 996 work schedule, making it impossible to continue active maintenance. 
        Due to this transition, support for SSMS 2016 was never implemented.
    </p>
    <p>   
        In 2024, I left that 'Large Company' to become an independent developer and decided to revive SQL Sharper. The new version, SQL Sharper 20, 
        is designed to support SSMS 20 while maintaining backward compatibility with older versions wherever possible.
